The  myElearning  content  management  platform  allow  students  to  submit  files  as  PDFs  or  Word  documents.  Generally,  students  are  required  to  follow  a  file  naming  convention  for  assignments.  However, this is not always specified nor is it always adhered to in practice. For example, Fig1 shows  actual  examples  of  file  naming  variations  used  by  students  for  an  assignment  (student  IDs  replaced  with a generic character string).
